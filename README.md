# Linux Made Easy
This repository is made with the intent to "make your life easy". It contains implementations of various python modules, linux commands and other scripts that can help in easy workarounds for things that are a part of the day to day usage.

## Keynotes
I currently use 3 OSes, namely Garuda(Arch based), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and the user friendly Windows 11. Most of the contents of this repo will Focus on Linux commands, but I'll try to include the windows workarounds too.

Well, there is no particular reason why I use three operating systems, it's just that I've configured cuda and related DL libraries on Ubuntu and windows is just for using MS office and gaming. Garuda is for the time when I need to focus on my work.
## Some Important Commands

 For both the linux based distros, some commands that I assume you know are:
``` code
sudo apt install "package-name"
mv (source) (dest)
sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb
cat file.extension
touch file.extension

```
The difference between Garuda and ubuntu in most of the operations is that instead of using the apt install, we use 
``` console
sudo pacman -Sy "package name"
```

Soon I'll publish the alias-user-customization codes that will make your CLI commands (generally much much longer than this) easier to use.







Enjoyy!!
